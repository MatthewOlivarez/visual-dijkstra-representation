# visual-dijkstra-representation
The program draws a graph and then discovers the path weights. Once they are known, the algorithm will then find the shortest path, and this will be displayed on the graph. You will need the drawing panel file for this program to compile and run, and that can be found here: https://www.buildingjavaprograms.com/code-files/4ed/javadoc/DrawingPanel.html
